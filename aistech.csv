AMETEK Land,http://www.ametek-land.com,Dronfield,Sheffield,United Kingdom,"Welcome to AMETEK Land!  AMETEK Land is the world’s leading manufacturer of monitors and analyzers for industrial infrared non-contact temperature measurement, combustion efficiency and environmental pollutant emissions.  Through its trusted range of leading-edge technologies, AMETEK Land is chosen the world over to deliver highly accurate measurement solutions that precisely meet process needs. With unrivalled applications knowledge, choosing AMETEK Land ensures the highest standards of process safety, process control and product quality are reached.  Designed to operate in the harsh environments found in steel production, AMETEK Land instruments are designed to the highest performance standards, optimized for making temperature measurements at every important stage of the process.  AMETEK Land provides comprehensive solutions supported by more than 70 years of experience serving the steel industry. Brands: LAND, LSP-HD, line scanners, HotSpotIR, SPOT, VIRALERT, SDS, MWIR-B-640, Auto Pour, SPOT GS, Cyclops AMETEK Land’s SPOT pyrometers / thermometers fall into three broad types: The best one to choose will depend on the product surface you want to measure, and the process environment.    A single wavelength Mono pyrometer is the simplest and cheapest solution, but for accurate temperature measurements you must have a clear view of the product and know the emissivity of the surface   The advantage of a dual wavelength Ratio pyrometer is that it can correct for dust, dirty windows, and for unknown or changing emissivity - as long as both wavelength channels are affected proportionally.   A more complex Application specific pyrometer is required for certain surfaces such as aluminium and galvanised / galvannealed steel where emissivity changes significantly with wavelength.  Emissivity is the key parameter to understand for accurate infrared temperature measurement.     The emissivity of a surface is the proportion of radiation that surface emits, compared to the maximum theoretically possible according to the laws of physics (the ‘blackbody radiation’).  Emissivity is the opposite of reflectivity, so a highly reflective smooth mirror-like surface has emissivity close to zero.  Rough, dark matt surfaces have high emissivity.  If you have two objects of the same temperature, one bright and shiny, one dark and matt, the dark one will feel hotter if you hold your hand in front of it as it radiates a higher proportion of its internal heat.  An infrared pyrometer measures the same effect that you feel.  With a Mono thermometer, you need to enter the correct emissivity value for the surface so that the pyrometer can correct for the reduced emission level, whereas Ratio and Application pyrometers can automatically fit and even calculate the emissivity.     Dirt and dust that obscure the view of a pyrometer have the same effect on the measurement as reduced emissivity – both reduce the amount of radiation collected.  If the level of obscuration remains constant, it would be possible to enter a correction factor as for emissivity and continue to use a Mono thermometer.  However, in many cases clouds of dust come and go, viewing windows become gradually dirtier between cleaning cycles.  A Ratio pyrometer is the device to choose in this case, which can automatically adjust for the changing obscuration level.   Ratio and Application pyrometers measure the infrared radiation received at two or more wavelengths – so they collect more data than a single wavelength Mono pyrometer.  If the surface emissivity or transmission level of the optical path is changing, there are effectively two unknowns to calculate: the proportion of radiation arriving at the instrument, and the temperature.  Given two measurement wavebands, it is possible to eliminate the reduced signal level from the equations and measure temperature accurately despite changing emissivity or obscuration.  In the SPOT range of Ratio pyrometers, the signal level is also provided as an output, and can be configured with an alarm as a ‘dirty window alert’.   An Application pyrometer is a more complex variant of the Ratio pyrometer, for materials whose emissivity changes with wavelength in a non-linear way.  In this case there are multiple unknowns: the temperature, the emissivity at each wavelength, and the complex relationship between the emissivity change at those different wavelengths.  For each temperature measured by an Application pyrometer, the instrument is calling on a huge ‘3D Dataset’ of historically measured values of temperature, emissivity and radiance at each waveband of the instrument.  For this reason, Application thermometers are only available for specific industrial process materials that we have thoroughly researched, such as the SPOT AL EQS for aluminium extrusion, quench and strip, and the SPOT GS for galvanised and galvannealed steel strip. AMETEK Land has enhanced its flare stack monitoring thermal imaging solution with the inclusion of its innovative, advanced image processing IMAGEPro software to deliver accurate and reliable monitoring of the flame and the pilot light at the flare stack.

Danieli,https://www.danieli.com/en,Buttrio,Udine,Italy,"Discover our vision on the metal industry.  Danieli designs, manufactures and installs metal producing plants and equipment worldwide, either on a turnkey basis or supplied as individual units, covering, with company-owned technology, the whole process cycle, from ore and scrap processing to finished flat, long, tube and extruded products, for ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Danieli plants are run by Danieli Automation process control, power and instrumentation systems, and include DIGI&MET smart manufacturing solutions (Industry 4.0). Sustainable production is guaranteed by energy-saving processes and Danieli Environment ecological solutions. 10,000 people operate in the Group companies located in Italy, Germany, Sweden, Austria, France, The Netherlands, Spain, UK, USA, Brazil, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, India and Japan. Brands: MIDA, QSP DUE, QLP DUE, Digimelter, Q-One, Q -Space, ENERGIRON, Q-Jenius, DanFIlters, Q’Roll Endless casting and rolling operations right from the first heat On December 18th, thanks to the joint efforts of Danieli and Nucor teams, Nucor Steel Florida safely started on schedule, melting, casting and rolling in endless mode from the first heat. Located in Frostproof, Florida, USA, the new MIDA minimill has a rated capacity of 380,000 shtpy and will produce rebar ranging from #3 to #11 (9.5 to 35.8 mm) in straight bars up to 60 ft, and spooled coils up to 5 tons. Featuring the latest energy-saving and environmentally friendly melting, the MIDA casting and rolling technologies significantly reduce the overall CO2 emissions thanks to the absence of the reheating furnace. With the Florida minimill, Nucor will satisfy the regional demand of steel rebar, recycling the scrap available in the area and reconfirming the Endless Casting and Rolling solution as a proven solution for a sustainable steel production. Nucor Steel Florida (NSFL) is the fourteenth Danieli MIDA minimill featuring Endless Casting-Rolling ECR technology for long products in operation worldwide - second for the Nucor group - and fourth in the USA. In January 2020, the first MIDA minimill for Nucor, Sedalia, Missouri also started up quickly, having the endless casting and rolling operations in place on third day and a “more than 1 km” long billet produced on the fifth day. The consistent start-up of this plant validates once more the full reliability of the MIDA endless casting and rolling process, which gives steelmakers the possibility to achieve a total transformation costs from 5 to 10 % lower than a traditional minimill. The Nucor Florida minimill composition: The MIDA endless casting-rolling process route includes the Danieli ECS® scrap preheating and continuous charging system, able to feed hot scrap continuously into a 40-t, side-charging, Fastarc AC EAF; and then a ladle furnace ensures the proper refining of the steel. A single-strand, high-speed continuous casting machine is the core of the endless casting-rolling section. It is equipped with the Danieli Fast Cast Cube (FCC) and a 130 x 130 mm square section Power-mould copper tube directly connected, through a 4 MW induction furnace, to an 8 + 8 stands ultra-compact rolling mill. The finishing facilities consist of an apron roller line, for the larger sizes, the Danieli-patented Direct Rolling and Bundling system (DRB) for the smaller range and a spooler line based on the “K-Spool” technologies, able to produce coils from rebar #3 to #8 in coils up to 5 tons. The latest Danieli technologies for an environmentally friendly and energy saving plant are also applied to the auxiliary units, which include the Fumes Treatment Plant, based on a Pulse-jet bag filter, the Water Treatment Plant, and the Danieli heavy duty technological and maintenance cranes serving the whole plant, from the scrap yard to finished products handling. Commercial Metals Company announced that CMC Steel Arizona in Mesa, AZ has begun receiving renewable energy from Salt River Project’s (SRP) new “Saint Solar” electricity generation plant. Irving, TX – Commercial Metals Company (CMC) announced that their micro mill in Mesa, Arizona, CMC Steel Arizona, has begun receiving renewable energy from Salt River Project’s (SRP) new “Saint Solar” electricity generation plant. CMC Steel Arizona was one of the original customers to join the first phase of SRP’s Sustainable Energy program that was announced in 2018. The Saint Solar plant, located in Coolidge, Arizona, is a 100-megawatt utility-based solar array that will provide renewable energy to CMC Steel Arizona and others in the SRP community. Constructed in 2009, CMC Steel Arizona is one of the most efficient and green steel producing facilities in the world. As a micro mill utilizing scrap-based Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) technology we are helping to preserve our natural resources. By using recycled scrap for 98% of our raw material, we reduce the need for natural resources. Our CO2 Scope 1 green-house gas emissions and energy consumption intensities are approximately 8 times less than the global steel making average. Tracy Porter, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, stated, “Our participation in the Saint Solar project underscores our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint further through the use of renewable energy as well as producing steel from 100% recycled scrap metal and being an industry leader in the sustainable steelmaking process.” On August 13, 2020, CMC announced plans to build its third micro mill, AZ2, adjacent to CMC Steel Arizona. The mill will be the first in the world to produce merchant bar quality (MBQ) products through a continuous-continuous production process. AZ2 will feature Danieli’s “Q-One” technology which will allow CMC to have a direct connection between the EAF and Ladle Furnace to renewable energy sources. This technology reduces electricity transmission losses as compared to traditional methods and associated operating costs. “SRP is excited to partner with CMC Steel Arizona on our shared renewable energy goals,” said Jim Pratt, Associate General Manager and Chief Customer Executive at SRP. “This is just the beginning of our sustainable energy partnership and we look forward to continuing to partner with them on AZ2 and beyond."" About Commercial Metals Company Commercial Metals Company and its subsidiaries manufacture, recycle and fabricate steel and metal products, related materials and services through a network of facilities that includes seven electric arc furnace (""EAF"") mini mills, two EAF micro mills, two rerolling mills, steel fabrication and processing plants, construction-related product warehouses, and metal recycling facilities in the U.S. and Poland. Featuring Danieli Zero-Scale Separator and patented high-speed DanFilters Commissioning is complete for the water treatment plant engineered, manufactured and installed at Nucor Steel, Sedalia minimill, Missouri, USA. The WTP was developed to serve the greenfield steel melt shop and rolling mill, in compliance with all applicable local standards (ASME, UL, NEMA, OSHA), fulfilling all contracted requirements, notably the environmental conditions. The original WTP design includes a Zero-Scale Separator, so as to avoid digging a scale pit and thus reducing excavation cost, simplify the civil works requirement. Danieli patented DanFilters perform with high filtration speed, achieving high efficiency in less overall space. A fiberglass tank was selected to allow a closed-circuit operation, rather than a concrete basin, further minimizing civil construction. The pumping station is comprised of vertical pumps to reduce the amount of piping needed, as well as civil work requirements. To expedite construction and installation, the WTP components were assembled on skids at the Danieli workshop, with pre-assembled and installed valves and instrumentation. Package-type cooling towers were selected, also for simple and fast installation. Danieli Automation Q-Space1 supporting digital assistance In the weeks starting from June 17, Factory Acceptance Tests for the hot-strip mill automation of Nucor Steel Gallatin QSP plant were executed at Danieli Automation, Italy. Q-Space1 allowed Nucor Steel Gallatin to participate in the tests despite travel restrictions linked to the current pandemic. Making the most of augmented, mixed and virtual reality, the FAT were conducted, supporting technicians throughout the field execution process, enhancing their skills for faster and more efficient completion of service and repair tasks. Danieli Automation Q-Space1 augmented reality, knowledge management features and artificial intelligence enabled the extended collaboration of teams by bringing together workers through a combination of live video, audio and annotations of the live shared view. The complete automation system of the hot-strip mill was installed in a dedicated space at Danieli Automation headquarters, along with the hardware and software infrastructure required for real-time data exchange and live shared views. Q-Space1 was set up with a fixed camera providing a panoramic view of the FAT area and a helmet-mounted camera to view the details of the main control desks and local control stations. Danieli Automation and Nucor teams ran the full set of tests as if they were in the same room, with the Nucor team actually operating the system from remote and the Danieli Automation team acting as lookouts and providing the “physical” interfacing with the automation hardware. Both teams were able to share the same application software tools in real time, providing clarification on the structure of various control functions. All the tests were completed successfully to the great satisfaction of both Nucor and Danieli Automation teams.

Electrotherm Refining Furnace with ELdFOS process is used for the following: Coal Based Rotary Kiln for Direct Reduced Iron / Sponge Iron (100 TPD, 350 TPD, 500 TPD) ince DRI is produced by removing oxygen from iron ore, its structure is just like sponge with a network of connecting pores. These pores results in a large internal surface area which is about 10,000 times greater than the internal surface area of solid iron. Due to this, DRI is also known as Sponge Iron. Sponge Iron is gaining more popularity because of the following reasons… Main Components of the Rotary Kiln are… The products offered are Ferrous & Non-Ferrous Billet Heating, Extrusion, Rolling, Soldering, Brazing, Heat Treatment including case hardening, Tempering and Annealing, Shrink Fitting, Strip Heating, Tube & wire heating, Continuous Annealing, Stress relieving etc… Induction heating is a process which is used to bond, harden or soften metals or other conductive materials. For many modern manufacturing processes, induction heating offers an attractive combination of speed, consistency and control.  Customer Benefit Applications  Forging and forming process consist of a part that has been previously heated to a temperature at which its resistance to deformation is weak. The forging temperatures of the most commonly used industrial materials are:  After heating up the material, the forming operation is done on different types of machines like mechanical presses, hydraulic presses, hammer, ring rolling etc. Materials used for forging are in shape of rounded bar, square billet. The process of forging and forming is a common process in the manufacture of many industrial sectors such as automobile, railway, aerospace, and forging. Advantages Equipment Rating  Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile. A material is pushed or drawn through a die of the desired cross-section. The extrusion process can be done with the material hot or cold. Extrusion may be continuous or semi-continuous. Materials required for this process is mention below Advantage Equipment Rating  Brazing is a process in which two or more materials are joined together by a filler metal that has a lower melting point than the base materials using induction heating. In brazing application joining of two pieces is done by process of using heat and a filler material that melts at a temperature above 427 ºC (800 ºF) and below the melting point of the parts to be brazen. The filler metal used in brazing varies depending on the parts being joined. The most preferred alloys are phosphor copper, silver, nickel and cobalt, aluminum, silicon, copper, copper-zinc and magnesium. In this process same material or different materials is permanently bond with high strength, simplify mechanical operation and adopt simple production techniques, always compatible with the demands of mass production among others. Advantages Application Equipment Rating  See Video1  Video2 Eletrotherm’s In-Line Induction heating system for hot rolling/ reheating of bars, billets, slabs, plates, and blooms.

"Force Control Industries, Inc.",http://www.forcecontrol.com,FAIRFIELD,OH,United States,"See the MagnaShear Oil Shear Crane Brake in Booth #2009.  The MagnaShear brake is a spring set electric release oil shear motor or flanged mounted brake. It is the perfect design for the severe duty crane applications in the steel industry. The design around Oil Shear Technology produces a brake that can handle high cycle dynamic stopping, no adjustment – ever, and no maintenance for years of service life. By reducing maintenance, adjustment, parts, repairs, spare parts and purchase orders the bottom line is lower operating costs and higher profits. Brands: MagnaShear, Posidyne, Posistop, Positorq, X-Class, CLPC The MagnaShear motor brake is a totally enclosed sealed brake for overhead cranes. It is designed for heavy use, hot environments, dirty, and wet applications in steel mills. Designed with Oil Shear Technology the MagnaShear Motor Brakes typically mount to the back of a brake motor. They are designed to be a stopping brake, not just a holding brake. Oil Shear Technology, perfected over 50 years by Force Control Industries, allows the brake to dynamically slip to a stop without wearing friction material, and the fluid circulating through the brake friction stack transfers the heat of engagement to the housing to be cooled. This allows the brake to operate at a consistant torque for many years without adjustment, or maintenance. They can survive the harsh environments of mining, manufacturing, material handling as well as packaging and food processing with minimal maintenance and no adjustment. The totally enclosed rugged housings keep dirt and moisture out while reducing noise and extracting heat. Dry friction brakes are typically designed as holding brakes. Using them for dynamic stopping wears friction material away causing constant adjustment and frequent replacement of discs, pads, or shoes.

GCI has developed a multi-probe flow RATA program called Precision Flow© that includes the Electronic Flow measurement portions of Methods 2H and 2G. GCI uses four probes mounted to the stack ports that allow several readings at each point with Delta P, Temperature and Angle averaged for each reading. This provides greater accuracy and also allows the Flow RATAs to be performed in one hour per load. This method reduces the high bias associated with manual flow methods but does not drastically affect the cost of the testing. Precision Flow© follows USEPA Methods 2G and 2H without modifications. GCI uses Method 4 for moisture determinations and Precision Flow© can be performed on the same day as the gas RATAs. The yaw angle determination described by Method 2G is used for all test runs and the flow RATA can still be completed in one hour per load.

Huebner Giessen,http://www.huebner-giessen.com,Atlanta,GA,United States,"Encoder solutions for motion control for the steel process   Johannes Huebner Giessen is a leading supplier in the fields of steel making facilities, rolling mills, finishing mills and material handling cranes. The company is regarded as a leader in the field of measurement, rotary encoder and drive technology. In over 80 years, Johannes Huebner Giessen has installed several thousand applications in heavy industry. As specialists they offer an all-round service worldwide, from capturing the on-site mounting situation to the assembly of the complete encoder systems. Johannes Huebner Giessen cooperates with major mechanical and electrical OEMs and drive manufacturers around the world as well. For metals applications, Johannes Huebner Giessen supplies encoder solutions for the complete metallurgical process chain starting with steel making via the different rolling processes to the finishing lines and steel plant cranes.  Brands: Incremental encoders, Absolute encoders, Universal encoder U-ONE, U-ONE Compact and U-ONE safety, Magnetic encoders, Electronic over speed switches, Electronic Position Switches, Analogue tachometers, Couplings and other mechanical accessories, Pulse converter and other electrical accessories The encoder ALS 40 or FGL 40 from Hübner Giessen is a specially developed encoder for most extreme environment conditions like we have at the looper of a hot strip mill. In rolling mills loopers are normally used to control the tension of the metal strip between roll stands. The rotational angle of the looper is measured by a feedback encoder designed to meet special requirements. The slight swing motions of the looper result in an unfavourable grease distribution in the ball bearings and thus in an insufficient built-up of a lubrication film formation. At nonmoving shaft high vibration loads can additionally contribute to local fatigue of the raceway and aging of the lubricant film. On site the encoder is furthermore subject to oil/cooling emulsion/water. The standard encoders used to date by customers have been unable to offer the required service life. Modular universal encoder system with up 10 functions in one unit: Speed, position, electronic overspeed switches, electronic position and cam switches, diagnostic and others. The U-ONE® is based on an universal basic unit connected to electronic function modules in the switchgear cabinet via optical-fiber cables that are immune to EMI. Alternatively, a compact version is available. There the electronic function modules are just backpacked to the detection unit. The electronic function modules are linked by an internal bus structure. A large number of possible electronic function modules results in high planning flexibility and easy expandability for later additional requirements. This concept offers considerable cost savings, thanks to its simple mechanical fitting, standardized electronic function modules, and reduced wiring requirements. Advantages at a glance: - Compact design - Central programming with self explaining software (Teach-in programming) - Extreme reduction of cable costs - Extreme reduction of commissioning time - Easy to extend (fiber optic version) - High flexibility - Saving spares - Solid shaft - Hollow shaft - NEMA C-Face and many more different types. - All possible signal outputs available such as HTL, TTL, SIN/COS - CE, UL, CSA approval - Explosion proofed types and Safety certified types (SIL certified) The absolute encoders made by Johannes Huebner Giessen are mechanically and electrically robust and reliable unit for use under the harshest ambient conditions. The encoders are providing position feedback and can also supply an incremental speed signal as option.   The absolute encoders are based on the latest photoelectrical scanning technology with highest accuracy on the market and are available in single turn or multi turn configuration. It supplies several output protocols such as ProfiBus, SSI, Parallel, EtherCAT and further more. The pulse-disk scanner consists of an LED and a specially designed optical system, with substantial separation between the disk and the scanning unit. Because the electronics board is encapsulated, the encoder are not susceptible to mechanical effects such as higher shock and vibration, loads and thermal expansion. Product details:  Advantages at a glance:  - Encoder with most robust aluminum housing existing on the market  - Extremely high resistance to vibration and shock  - Degree of protection up to IP 67  - Latest sensor technology for highest signal accuracy for high end process quality   - Up to 28 bit resolution  - Internal diagnostic with error output  - Safety certified types available (SIL certified) Major benefits and features are: - High switching accuracy - Preset function with home position - Programming software simplifies parameter setting - Save and import parameter datas - Significantly shorter downtimes for readjustment, e.g. after rope exchange on a ladle crane - Up to 15 relay outputs - Optional real-time position data (4-20mA output) - Error output Replaces Electro Cam, Stromag, Leonard (Vollenbroich), Gessmann Features: - programmable switching speeds - underspeed and overspeed monitoring - independant cw and ccw rotation monitoring - shock and vibration resistant - IP 65 protection rating as standard - Safety certified (SIL) as option If you have questions about Exhibiting or Sponsoring AISTech please contact sales@aist.org Copyright , a2z, Inc.

The Test Lab is designed in compliance with Hydraulic Institute Standards and API 610. It’s capable of testing horizontal, vertical, and submersible pumps up to 5,000 HP. With pump testing at Hydro, Inc.’s Test Lab, customers can improve reliability, reduce unforeseen costs, and prevent pump failures.  Testing can be applied to new pumps, refurbished pumps, or re-engineered pumps with the focus being on reliability, assurance of meeting the required operating conditions, and measuring the actual changes in performance if a change was made.  The rising cost of electrical power has caused many industrial plants to shift their focus to energy efficiency. Plants often run pumping equipment continuously, and much research has pointed to opportunities for cost savings by optimizing pumping equipment. When evaluating the potential for energy savings, end users cannot consider a pump in isolation. The suitability of the pump for the system within which it operates is vital. Even the best designed and most efficient equipment offers power-saving potential if it is run off its best efficiency point (BEP) in a system for which it is ill-applied.

Operating costs are also reduced since the unit motor operates only when rod motion is required. 2.  Modular stacked construction:   The design of most Kerry Actuators is such that all modular control components are assembled directly to the pump. This is an improvement on other comparable systems and is exclusive to the Kerry Actuator. 3.  Sealed hydraulic circuit:   The entire unit is sealed from the atmosphere. This important feature eliminates the entry of dirt and moisture into the system and renders a long maintenance free unit service life.

Plattco Corp.,http://www.plattco.com,Plattsburgh,NY,United States,"Welcome to Plattco see our Double flap valves and Slidegates  Plattco Double Flap Airlock Valves are economically and operationally better then rotary valves. Plattco invented the double flap valve in 1958 as a alternative to the rotary valve.  Today, many are purchased in place of rotary valves by bottom-line oriented managers who insist on valves that require less maintenance & improved productivity. Our products provide a long-term solution to rotary valve wear and jamming by eliminating the rotary action of other valves.  The body of the valve is not part of the seal allowing for decades of use.  The seat and flapper, which provide the critical seal, are cast and machined of wear-resistant alloys and can be replaced quickly and easily without disassembling the valve or taking it out of line.  Designed to provide many years of maintenance-free service. The Plattco valve design eliminates bridging and clogging to maximize operating efficiency.

SARRALLE is proud to announce the three EPC projects award in three different steel plants of COGNOR GROUP in Poland. The modernization of the whole facilities will last 14 months and will allow the Polish steel group to double its production.  SARRALLE is responsible for the engineering, supply of equipment, supervision of the assembly and commissioning of the plant of the 2 Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF), 1 Fume Exhaust System (FES) and 1 Rolling Mill (RM) that will be operational by the end of 2019.  Works will be conducted at the COGNOR GROUP’s production division branches HSJ branch in Stalowa Wola, Ferrostal Łabędy branch in Gliwice and Ferrostal Łabędy branch in Kraków, which produce semi-finished and finished steelworks products, both long (smooth bars, flat bars, sections) and flat (thick and thin sheets) for the machinery, mining, energy, railway and defence industries.   HSJ BRANCH IN STALOWA WOLA – EAF UPGRADE COGNOR will modernize its EAF to increase its productivity from 200.000 Tons per year to 400.000 Tons per year. The scope of work consist of:   The execution of the work will last 40 weeks and the first heat is expected to be by the month of September this year.  FERROSTAL ŁABĘDY BRANCH IN GLIWICE – EAF AND FES UPGRADE The plant upgrade will include the following production units:   In order to reduce the shutdown period SARRALLE performed the works in two different phases: first one; new spark arrester, filter, fans and chimney installed in parallel to the existing aiming to increase extraction capacity and filtering of the plant and the second phase, the primary circuit and secondary circuit. The execution of the work will last 14 months and the first heat is expected to be by the month of September this year.  FERROSTAL ŁABĘDY BRANCH IN KRAKÓW – ROLLING MILL UPGRADE The duplicity of the production will allow to increase the outcome of the rebars and profiles as well. Therefore, improvements needed to be accomplished in the Rolling Mill area.  The execution of the work will last 12 months and the first heat is expected to be next summer.  Although it is the first Rolling Mill project for COGNOR GROUP, SARALLE Rolling Mill counts with experience in the country with the audit of a rolling mill of ARCELORMITTAL in Warsaw. Poland is an emerging country with many opportunities for SARRALLE. Currently, we are quoting for many more projects and we expect to be awarded soon.  After commissioning mentioned projects, COGNOR GROUP will have the state of the art equipment, increasing the productivity of its current workshops with an appropriate return of investment and complying with the Environmental Regulations through sustainable practices. SARRALLE has been awarded two projects in France and Germany for the international APERAM Group consisting of the improvement and modernization of the plants dedicated to the transformation of stainless steel flat products.  APERAM FRANCE The project for APERAM Isbergues (France) will allow the group to increase the capacity of its LC2I process line, virtually unique in the world in the treatment of hot-rolled stainless steel of continuous rolling, pickling and finishing of stainless steel. The installation processes continuously stainless steel, doing the pickling, rolling, normalizing, skin pass and flattened under tension, resulting in first quality coils ready for final sale. The start-up of this new line was carried out at the beginning of the current year and the work is the result of SARRALLE's engineering study to modernize the facilities of APERAM France.  APERAM GERMANY The project for APERAM Haan (Germany) will allow this group to completely renovate its current facilities in Duisburg and transfer it to the new facilities located in Haan at 50 kilometres. This is a complex project in which SARRALLE will manufacture new machines for APERAM, improve and modernize the existing ones and also renew the cross-sectional line of the APERAM Duisburg plant. Precisely this line will be dismantled from its current location plant and transferred to the new location, with a total change in the distribution of material flow allowing a very important logistics improvement. The OCEVI cutting line is a stainless cutting line that manufactures sheet steel for multiple applications, such as the food industry, industrial processes, catering, elevators and stairs, and so on. SARRALLE considers these two projects strategic, given that it involves the expansion of its metal coil processing division in the European market. SARRALLE successfully completes the expansion from 65,000 tons to 110,000 tons/annually recycling capacity of steelworks powder on time and within budget for Befesa S.A. in Turkey. The execution of the turnkey project includes the design, engineering, manufacturing, assembly, civil works and start-up phase of the new facility.  Production line equipment and installations affected by this revamping will consist of the main following units: rotary kiln & dust settling chamber, off gases system, raw material handling and DLWO washing plant and waste treatment plant.  BEFESA the world market leader for steel dust and aluminium salt slags recycling services, started the works at the end of January at its site in Iskenderum and reopened the facilities and resumed operations this week.  The industrial activity of the plant, fits into the eco-industry sector because it works recycling Electric Arc Steelmaking and Foundry dusts, whose contains heavy metals like zinc and lead.  SARRALLE is settling as an international engineering and manufacturer of critical environmental, regulated services to the steel and waste to energy industries. Through its business units, SARRALLE executed in this case the valorization of more amount of steel dust to obtain zinc and slag that otherwise will be disposed in the landfill. SARRALLE manufactures the equipment to manage and recycle of residues, becoming a source of renewable raw material/product, which our customers reintroduce in the market, reducing the consumption of natural resources and downsizing the cost of production. This will allow to close the production process in a sustainable way, reusing all the elements of the process. SARRALLE Processing Lines celebrates the acceptance of the modernization project of the cut-to-length line (CTL) in APERAM - Haan (Germany). Manufacturer of 100% recyclable stainless steel products, which gives it a fair and sustainable organizational position with the lowest CO2 footprint in the world within its sector. CHECK THE VIDEO OF THE PROJECT THROUGH THIS LINK !   The project that started in 2019 and ended at the end of 2020, consisted of dismantling, modernizing and moving an existing cross-section line from the original plant at Aperam-Duisburg to allocate it in another site 50 km away from Aperam in Germany, specifically in Hann.  The scope of the intervention does not only consist in the transfer of the same, but also includes a great engineering effort both in the existing installation and in the new machines incorporated into it. The work that was carried out entirely by SARRALLE consisted of the following phases:  Dismantling: the existing line in Duisburg was completely dismantled and the parts that we later use for the new line were reserved.  Modernization: the engaged machines were updated with their corresponding maintenance, lubrication, cleaning and painting.  Moving to Haan: the revamped parts were moved to the new Haan location.  Civil works: APERAM needed to start up the installation as soon as possible and, considering the situation of the client SARRALLE, adapted and initiated the assembly with the civil works not yet finalized. SARRALLE demonstrated its flexibility, reorganized its work teams, and modified its project planning in order to reduce assembly times.   Engineering:  Mechanical engineering: SARRALLE designs, manufactures and integrates new machines that are key to the added value of the existing CTL line. Regarding the existing machines, SARRALLE made improvements for the good use and performance in the new line.  Electrical engineering and automation: the electrical engineering and automation was totally new and complete. This engineering is done entirely at the SARRALLE facilities. Due to the full control of the supply chain, we were able to meet customer demands with the new Siemes S7 TIA PORTAL software. As a result, APERAM has a fully automated line with totally new electrical equipment, including new electrical cabinets and desks, as well as new wiring in the facility.    Manufacturing executions systems (MES): SARRALLE has integrated the cutting line into APERAM's ERP, communicating the cutting line with APERAM's Level II. Thanks to this development in the software, it is now possible to launch their manufacturing orders directly to the production line from the customer's ERP. The operator saves the task of specifying the manufacturing parts. Consequently, the ""intelligent"" line is capable of configuring the machines depending on the range of product to be manufactured.  Manufacturing: due to our own workshops, all the manufacturing of the equipment was carried out by us, without depending on third parties to offer a turnkey solution.   Likewise, APERAM currently not only has a more productive line, but also has greater versatility in its new CTL. After the integration of a gantry unstucker, the line gains a very important volatility. Now, the client has the ability to manufacture sheets with lengths and in special qualities that the market will undoubtedly appreciate.   Given the complexity of the project, we have managed to make the almost impossible possible. Starting from an outdated line, we managed to convert it into a totally new line with a higher production capacity and versatility that the customer did not have before. This is not our first project with APERAM, but we have a relationship of great trust, which will allow us to continue collaborating in the future Founded in 1965, and nowadays with more than 50 years’ experience on international projects, SARRALLE is your partner in the Environment, Energy & Steel Worlds.

SPANMASTER Workstation Cranes
TC/A Box Girders
Jaso Industrial Hoists, End Trucks, and Crane Kits TC/American is very proud to announce our new Enclosed Track Work Station Cranes. SPANMASTER Work Station Crane Systems are available in both freestanding and ceiling-mounted designs. SPANMASTER Work Station Crane capacities range from 250 lbs to 4400 lbs. Stretching beyond our competitors, we designed our ergonomic enclosed track system to handle overall bridge lengths up to 38’6″. SPANMASTER bridges are designed for a 1′ overhang which provides a maximum crane bridge span of 36’6″. The final differentiating factor is the unique range of motion provided by SPANMASTER’S unique end truck design. TC/American’s patented articulating end truck design allows the crane to manipulate more like a jib crane when loaded at one end. Our SPANMASTER Sytems use a fixed runway beam with an oscillating, articulating, and pivoting bridge. The bridge articulation is achieved by our Patented SPANMASTER end trucks. Our end trucks feature a unique ball pivot and u-hanger design which allows the bridge to manipulate similar to a jib crane. Through the lever-action created by the u-hanger lower pivots, operator effort to move the load is reduced significantly. With our unique end truck design we are seeing push/pull forces as low as 100:1. A major factor when deciding if a solution will work for a particular application is the crane bridge end approach. TC/American’s SPANMASTER Work Station Cranes remove that variable from the equation. SPANMASTER end trucks vary in overall length depending on the capacity and bridge span of the crane, but our largest end truck (4400 lb Capacity) comes in at an overall length of only 9.375″! This should make SPANMASTER your go-to solution when looking to maximize end approach. When we were designing our new SPANMASTER Work Station Crane System, we wanted to create an easier and more cost-effective solution for our customers. By utilizing a non-proprietary wide flange runway we are able to provide a large variety of benefits with choosing a SPANMASTER System:  What’s the Difference? Time after time. Year after year. We’ve built the perfect beast of burden – the best overhead rail/trolley system for mov­ing all kinds of material in all kinds of ways. We discovered years ago that conventional I-beam systems have a lot of shortcomings. Solving those problems led to our TC/American patented track system – the one to trust for dependable workhorse performance day in, day out.   Every TC/American track and trolley system offers complete design flexibility. You can move loads easily throughout your plant in precisely the patterns you choose. And because it’s engineered with standard components wherever possible, this superior system can also cut installation costs. But most important, it delivers smoother performance, longer, with less maintenance. RAIL LINE   The backbone of any monorail or crane system is the rail. At TC/American Crane Company, we manufacture rails specifically designed to provide maximum strength, flexibility, and durability. Our rail uses high carbon-manganese steel tee sections which are rolled to close tolerances for maximum strength and long life while keeping weight to a minimum. These special alloy steel tee sections provide many years of dependable service, as compared to common structural steel beams which are mild steel and not precision made. TC/American Crane offers patented track in numerous standard rail configurations for a variety of applications up to 20-ton or more capacity. Hoists There are different configuration types of hoists. SUPPORTED HOIST With gear wheels and pinions manufactured with case hardened steel, we achieve small high-performance gears. The perfect solution for auxiliary processes. SINGLE GIRDER HOIST The best option for use in reduced spaces. It consists of two trolleys (motorized and auxiliary) with two wheels that turn on bearings attached to plates which are duly mechanized and joined by bolts. DOUBLE GIRDER HOIST The perfect hoist to achieve a combination of stability, balance, and lifting height. Made up of a frame formed by two end-carriages, mechanized after assembly, in order to ensure the perfect alignment of the wheels. V hoist product range (Lifting frequency inverter) N hoist product range (two-speed motor) End Carriage End Carriages and Travelling Gears Each end carriage is composed of: Structure Built as a structural section or box-shaped and machined after assembly, in order to ensure a perfect alignment of the wheels.

Thermal-Tec Inc,http://www.thermal-tec.com,Cedar Springs,MI,United States,"We Fix Commercial Melt Shop Roofs    Brands: MR Multi-ply® Roof System MR Multi-ply® Roof System – Our patented roofing system is the industry standard when it comes to providing a permanent roofing solution, specifically designed for commercial sized facilities. Our product ensures extended durability, flexibility, added tensile strength aprox: (80,000-100,000 lbs) per square footage, all while carrying a UL and FM class A fire-rating. We’re the experts when it comes to our roofing solution.  We engineered it. We install it. We warranty it. There is no middle-man or sub-contractor. This insures three things: faster installation time, less people on your roof, and no additional outside resources needed. We decided long ago that safety wasn’t just about compliance. It was to become a cornerstone of culture. Commercial roofing is a dangerous business. When it comes to “complying” with official requirements put forth by governing bodies, i.e. OSHA, NRCA, etc. we recognize that many “industry” requirements are made to cover a wide-variety of roofing applications. What is considered safe for one company may not go far enough to ensure absolute safety for a different company. That’s why we set our own safety requirements in addition to standard compliance. Transite is a common asbestos containing construction material that was widely used between the 1950s-1980s.   Its insulation and fire retardant properties became the driving factors for inclusion on High-temperature, commercial and industrial buildings The custom, form-fit nature of our product not only encapsulates the toxic material, it improves the longevity of the entire building structure, thanks to the added 80,000-100,000 lbs of tensile strength per square foot.  This accomplishes two things: keeping the transite out of landfills, while your building retains the insulation and fire-retardant benefits of the transite by keeping your roof intact.

VIEWTECH BORESCOPES ACQUIRES NEW CLIENTS REPLACING OUTDATED VISUAL INSPECTION SCOPES   VJ-3 Video Borescope Chosen to Complete New Inspection Requirements TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.,– Whether an inspection application requires a small diameter borescope to enter a narrow access port or one that can articulate as it navigates through lengthy piping, ViewTech Borescopes VJ-3 video borescopes are utilized and relied upon throughout every industry. North America’s lineup of top-selling articulating video borescopes caught the attention of two of their newest clients, a manufacturer of oceanographic measurement equipment and a global energy supplier. A Production Engineer for an oceanographic equipment manufacturing company sought a new visual inspection tool to assist with product design. It was essential the borescope feature brighter lighting and an improved image quality than their current borescope was equipped with. Through ViewTech Borescopes no-cost, no-obligation demo offer, their Washington based facility was able to trial a VJ-3 2.8mm x 1.0-meter video borescope. With hands-on experience utilizing the VJ-3, the ViewTech borescope documented areas not visually accessible during previous remote visual inspections (RVI). The decision to purchase was easy to quantify by their engineering team. Another of ViewTech’s newest clients, a global energy supplier, was not able to complete necessary inspections. With their current borescope too large to access chiller tubes, it was critical they purchase an inspection tool specifically for this application. After researching new borescopes for sale, they immediately considered ViewTech’s VJ-3 video borescope. The video borescope requirements their Operations & Maintenance Supervisor deemed crucial were: 360-degree articulation, more than 20 feet of insertion tube, and a diameter smaller than half of one inch. The borescope experts at ViewTech recommended they trial a VJ-3 Dual Camera. While many borescopes use side view attachments or interchangeable viewing angle tips, with the ViewTech Dual Camera borescope, simply pushing a button toggles between front-view and side-view cameras. After their free demo VJ-3 Dual Camera was onsite and chiller tube inspections complete, the ViewTech video borescope was purchased by their O&M Supervisor.   The VJ-3 2.2mm video borescope is available with an ultra-thin 2.2-millimeter insertion tube and length of 1.0 meter.
